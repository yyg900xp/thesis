# thesis
The Matlab code insde this respiratory are for Monte Carlo method applied to the time fractional diffusion Cauchy problem research project .

# Chapter2
Inside Chapter2 folder, the code are for the reproductivity of the histogram of the stable distributions and the path of the stochastic processes that are needed for the project (Brownian motion and alpha-stable subordinator)

# Chapter4
Inside Chapter4 folder, the code are for the reproductivity of the approximating solutions to the time fractioanl diffusion Cauchy problem.
